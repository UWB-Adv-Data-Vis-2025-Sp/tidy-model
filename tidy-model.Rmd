## Introduction

This R Markdown document demonstrates my abilities to use models for data analysis.

```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```

## Whats that sound?

In this report we examine what factors predict a cricket's chirp rate. Our data contains 31 observations of crickets including two species. Data reports temperature from 17 to 30 degrees C. The mean chirp rate is 73 chirps per minute.

```{r summary, echo= FALSE}
summary(crickets)
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 8) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of the chirp rate of crickets") +
  xlab('Chirp rate (per min.)')
```
