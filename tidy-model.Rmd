## Introduction

This R Markdown document demonstrates my abilities to use models for data analysis.

```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```

## What is that sound?

In this report we examine what factors predict a cricket's chirp rate. Our data contains 31 observations of crickets including two species. Data reports temperature from 17 to 30 degrees C. The mean chirp rate is 73 chirps per minute.

```{r summary, echo= FALSE}
summary(crickets)
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 8) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of the chirp rate of crickets") +
  xlab('Chirp rate (per min.)')
```

## Temperature affects chirp rate

```{r temp, echo= FALSE}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  ggtitle("Plot of temperature and chirp rate") +
  ylab('Chirp rate (per min.)') +
  xlab('Temperature (Celsius)')

temp_lm <- lm(rate ~ temp, crickets)

summary.lm(temp_lm)
```
Based on a scatter plot of temperature and chirping and a correlation test, it seems that as temperature increases one degree, the rate of chirping increases about 4.2 chirps per minute.

## Species-specific effects of temperature on chirp rate

```{r species, echo= FALSE}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  ggtitle("Plot of temperature and chirp rate for two species of crickets") +
  ylab('Chirp rate (per min.)') +
  xlab('Temperature (Celsius)')

  
species_lm <- lm(rate ~ temp + species, crickets)

summary.lm(species_lm)
```


## Interactions

```{r species historgram, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(position = 'identity', alpha = 0.7, bins = 8) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of the chirp rate of two crickets") +
  xlab('Chirp rate (per min.)')
```

After revising the histogram of temperature distributions, it is clear that the two cricket species occupy different temperature ranges.


```{r interactions, echo= FALSE}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  ggtitle("Plot of temperature and chirp rate for two species of crickets") +
  ylab('Chirp rate (per min.)') +
  xlab('Temperature (Celsius)')
  
  
species_x_temp_lm <- lm(rate ~ temp + species + temp:species, crickets) 
summary.lm(species_x_temp_lm)

anova(species_lm, species_x_temp_lm)
```

The model accounts for interaction models does not seem to be more powerful for predicting chirping rates.
