# tidy-model
Template file for homework assignment to learn to use R syntax for creating models in tidyverse.

For this assignment we will learn how to represent data with a model and take advantage of some of the tools in the tidyverse that will make working with data easier. 

## Before you get started

Familiarize yourself with linear regression. Watch the YouTube videos, [Linear Regression: Vary Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkjP5RJLQF4) and [Linear Regression, Algebra, Equations, and Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAgYLRy7e20&list=PLIeGtxpvyG-LoKUpV0fSY8BGKIMIdmfCi&index=2), about linear models and how to interpret them. Additionally, you may want to read about [Software for modeling in *Tidy Modeling with R*](https://www.tmwr.org/software-modeling.html) by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge.

For this assignment we will be using resources from [A review of R modeling fundamentals in *Tidy Modeling with R*](https://www.tmwr.org/base-r.html) and 
The sections on modeling form [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) by Hadley and Grolemund: 

22.  [Introduction](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-intro.html)
23.  [Model basics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html) 
24.  [Model building](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-building.html)

## Instructions

For this assignment, we will begin by creating a new R Markdown document. Select **New File** and **R Markdown**. Give the document the title "tidy-model" and add your name as the author. Save the new file as `tidy-model.Rmd`.
